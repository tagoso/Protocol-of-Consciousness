# Social Practices: Phantoming and Zombifying

Within the Protocol of Consciousness (PoC), the line between [Genuine and Fake can never be objectively secured](../../protocol/unguaranteability-all-loops-are-perhaps-loops.md). This undecidability is not a flaw but a structural condition of consciousness itself. Out of this condition emerge social practices that manage — and exploit — the fragility of recognition.

Two of the most striking are **Phantoming** and **Zombifying**, which function as mirror images of one another:

* [**Phantoming**](phantoming-social-practice-of-making-fake-genuine.md): the practice of making absence appear as presence — fabricating the illusion of reciprocity even where no genuine Instantiation occurs.
* [**Zombifying**](zombifying-social-practice-of-making-genuine-fake.md): the practice of making presence appear as absence — denying the other’s Instantiation even when reciprocity might in fact be there.

Together, these paired practices reveal how societies handle the instability of consciousness: sometimes by staging it where it is lacking, sometimes by erasing it where it may exist. They show that consciousness, as lived in social life, is never a fixed essence but always contested, staged, and renegotiated.
