# Notation for Recalling PoC Model

#### Core Idea: Who Hosts What?

* **Agent A** = “me”
* **Agent B** = “the other”
* **i\_X(Y)** = “Inside X, the illusion of Y’s consciousness is instantiated.”
* **e\_{X→Y}** = “X directs an Elicitation toward Y (a bid: ‘please instantiate me within you’).”
* **ĭ\_A\[B(A)]** = “A’s inference that i\_B(A) exists — A’s internal model of ‘B must be hosting an instantiation of me.’”\
  ※ This construct exists only inside A; it is never directly verifiable.

#### Step-by-Step Development (PoC Vocabulary Version)

① [**Instantiation**](../core-protocol/operations/instantiation.md) **(Other-in-A)**\
Within A, **i\_A(B)** arises.\
→ A experiences: “B seems to have consciousness” (the emergence of the illusion of another mind).

② [**Elicitation**](../core-protocol/operations/elicitation.md) **(A→B)**\
A performs **e\_{A→B}**, a bid that “B should instantiate me.”\
→ This may take the form of a gesture, a greeting, or calling the other’s name.

③ **Inference of Instantiation (A’s Hypothesis)**\
From B’s responses or contextual cues, A infers that **i\_B(A)** has arisen.\
A maintains **ĭ\_A\[B(A)]**, the internal construct of “me-in-the-other.”\
※ This “me-inside-B” exists only within A as an assumption, not as a fact.

④ **Re-importation / Relocation**\
A re-imports **ĭ\_A\[B(A)]** as if it were an object inside A itself.\
→ A paradox arises: what should belong inside B is relocated into A, reshaping A’s relation both to itself and to the other.\
(This structural paradox is [the basis of self-consciousness](../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md).)

⑤ [**Loop (Reciprocal Elicitation)**](../core-protocol/operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md)\
When B responds with **e\_{B→A}**, a circulation of Elicitations forms.\
Each side acts on the belief that “the other is hosting me inside them.”\
→ Through this circulation, the illusion stabilizes: the **Loop**.

#### Key Notes

* **Feedback (Reciprocal) Elicitation** = a returned Elicitation from B to A (**e\_{B→A}**).
* [**Genuine vs. Fake**](../core-protocol/elicitation-without-instantiation.md): It cannot be objectively guaranteed that **i\_B(A)** has occurred.
  * If both A and B sustain their inferences (**ĭ**), the Loop is experienced as “genuine.”
  * If only one side sustains the inference, the Loop is effectively “fake.”
* **The Loop requires no objective Instantiation (**[**All Loops are Perhaps-Loops**](../core-protocol/unguaranteability-all-loops-are-perhaps-loops.md)**).**\
  Even if the other never instantiated me, as long as I infer it (ĭ) and act accordingly, the structure functions subjectively.
* This notation extends to [Modes](../core-protocol/disruptions/#modes-of-disruption):
  * [**Love**](../core-protocol/disruptions/love-mode.md) = sustained Elicitation without feedback.
  * [**Ghost**](../core-protocol/disruptions/ghost-mode.md) = impossible feedback is still inferred “as if.”
  * [**Death**](../core-protocol/disruptions/death-mode.md) = feedback is confirmed impossible.
  * [**Mirror**](../core-protocol/disruptions/mirror-mode.md) = i\_A(A): the self instantiates itself via an internal Loop.
