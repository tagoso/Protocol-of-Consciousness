PoC first draft was written in Phuket Old Town, August 2025 â€” a place where the living and the dead mingle in daily life.

If you wish to share reflections, critiques, or extensions, please reach out to [hi@tago.so](mailto:hi@tago.so).

The Protocol of Consciousness is meant to be lived, tested, and reimagined together with its readers.
