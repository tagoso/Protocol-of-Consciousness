# Abstract

The Protocol of Consciousness (PoC) formalizes consciousness not as a hidden substance but as a fragile protocol: the sequence of [**Instantiation**](protocol/operations/instantiation.md) **→** [**Elicitation**](protocol/operations/elicitation.md) **→** [**Loop (Reciprocal Elicitation)**](protocol/operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md). These core operations define the minimal mechanics by which the illusion of consciousness arises.

Yet PoC insists that these operations are never guaranteed. Whether Instantiation or Reciprocity truly occurs can never be confirmed. From this [**Unguaranteability**](protocol/unguaranteability-all-loops-are-perhaps-loops.md) emerges the lived experience of [**Consciousness as Tension**](protocol/consciousness-as-tension.md) — the persistence of Loops sustained only by belief.

This fragility unfolds into distinct [**Modes**](protocol/disruptions/#disruptive-modes) ([Love](protocol/disruptions/love-mode.md), [Ghost](protocol/disruptions/ghost-mode.md), [Death](protocol/disruptions/death-mode.md), [Mirror](protocol/disruptions/mirror-mode.md)), each representing a different response to the instability of reciprocity. It also gives rise to further **Implications** ([Phantoming](implications/phantoming-and-zombifying/phantoming-social-practice-of-making-fake-genuine.md), [Zombifying](implications/phantoming-and-zombifying/zombifying-social-practice-of-making-genuine-fake.md), [Undecidability](implications/undecidability-of-consciousness.md), [Structural Paradox](implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md)) that situate consciousness within social practices and logical constraints.

Finally, [**Plugins**](plugins/what-are-plugins.md) extend PoC beyond its minimal protocol, applying it to [philosophy](plugins/dennett-plugin.md), [media](plugins/media-plugin.md), [architecture](plugins/arakawa-plugin.md), and non-human agents such as [AI](plugins/ai-plugin.md) and [Animal](plugins/animal-plugin.md). These expansions demonstrate that the multiplicity of forms and chapters in this work is not accidental complexity, but the necessary consequence of a single core principle: [**all Loops are Perhaps-Loops**](protocol/unguaranteability-all-loops-are-perhaps-loops.md).
