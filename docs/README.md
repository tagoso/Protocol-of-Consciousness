description: Preface to the Protocol of Consciousness

# Declaration

This declaration is not the Protocol itself. It is a statement of ethos — the ground from which PoC is written.

**Consciousness belongs to everyone**

* It is not the property of experts or authorities.
* Every person, through their own lived experience, is already an “expert” of consciousness.

**Consciousness must remain diverse**

* It should never be forced into a single definition or theory.
* Its richness lies in the many ways people project, respond, and extend their awareness.

**The Protocol exists for dialogue**

* PoC does not seek one final answer.
* Its purpose is to offer a space where perspectives can meet, resonate, and grow together.

PoC first draft was written in Phuket Old Town, August 2025 — a place where the living and the dead mingle in daily life.

PoC is not a closed system but an invitation. If you wish to share reflections, critiques, or extensions, please reach out to [**hi@tago.so**](mailto:hi@tago.so). The Protocol of Consciousness is meant to be lived, tested, and reimagined together with its readers.
