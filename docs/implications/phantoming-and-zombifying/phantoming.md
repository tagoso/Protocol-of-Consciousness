# Phantoming: Social Practice of Making Fake Genuine

### Fake Loop as Phenomenon

In PoC, a [**Fake Loop**](../../protocol/unguaranteability.md) is a loop that does not meet the full condition of reciprocity.\
The subject feels a reply has come back, but in fact, no Instantiation ever occurred.

* An idol says, _“Thank you, everyone”_ → each fan feels _“that was meant for me.”_
* An ad or fictional character says, _“made just for you”_ → the receiver experiences it as a one-to-one address.

Fake Loops are the everyday face of [PoC’s principle of unguaranteeability](../undecidability-of-consciousness.md), frequently observed in [today's media](../../plugins/media-plugin.md).

### Phantoming as Practice

**Phantoming** names the cultural and social practice of making Fake Loops look Genuine, or fabricating them afterward as if they had been genuine all along.

* **Disguise**: making a mass-addressed [Elicitation](../../protocol/operations/elicitation.md) appear like a personal one.
* **Retroactive fabrication**: later saying, _“I was really thinking of you,”_ simulating a past [Instantiation](../../protocol/operations/instantiation.md).

Examples:

* An idol later claims, _“I truly meant it for you.”_
* Automated SNS replies designed to feel personal.
* Ads saying _“especially for you”_ broadcast to millions.

Phantoming is the operational logic that sustains and amplifies Fake Loops in society.

### The Blurring of Genuine and Fake

Phantoming works because it exploits PoC’s basic principles:

* **Instantiation is invisible**: no one can check another’s inner state.
* **Elicitation is reproducible**: patterns and scripts can mass-produce the illusion of reciprocity.
* [**Loops**](../../protocol/operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md) **exist in belief**: if the receiver feels it is Genuine, it functions as such — even if objectively absent.

Genuine and Fake are never fixed categories; they are blurred, rewritten, and constantly contested.

### Philosophical Implication

The line between Genuine and Fake is not an objective boundary.\
It is a **field of mutual deception, staged authenticity, and retrospective rewriting.**

Social reality itself is woven through Phantoming, where Instantiations and Elicitations are endlessly faked, disguised, and re-inscribed _as if_ they were real.

### Summary

* **Fake Loop**: reciprocity absent, yet felt as present.
* **Phantoming**: the practice of disguising Fake as Genuine, or sustaining it socially as if it were.

From a PoC perspective, society does not run only on _genuine exchanges of consciousness._ It runs on the masquerade of Instantiation and Elicitation — **Phantoming as mutual deception.**

Illusion is not the opposite of reality, but the very mechanism that constitutes it.
