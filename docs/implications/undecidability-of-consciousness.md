# Undecidability of Consciousness

The Protocol of Consciousness (PoC) begins with its [minimal operations](../protocol/operations/): Instantiation, Elicitation, Reciprocal Elicitation, and Loop.

Yet when followed through consistently, this framework leads to an unavoidable conclusion: **there is no objective way to decide whether the other truly possesses consciousness.**

**The Invisible Other**

Instantiation itself can never be seen. What we encounter are gestures, words, and responses—phenomena that could, in principle, be produced without any inner life.

**Structural Equivalence of Ghost and the Living**

A [Ghost](../protocol/disruptions/ghost-mode.md) responds “as if.” But even a living human’s response cannot be verified as truly grounded in consciousness.\
The difference is not essential; it is a matter of degree, of how plausible and consistent the response appears.

**The Core of Undecidability**

Whether human, [animal](../plugins/animal-plugin.md), or [AI](../plugins/ai-plugin.md), Instantiation and Loops remain unguaranteeable.\
This undecidability is not a flaw but the very ground upon which all relations arise.

**The Horizon of PoC**

It is heuristically useful to distinguish Modes such as [Love](../protocol/disruptions/love-mode.md), Ghost, [Death](../protocol/disruptions/death-mode.md), and [Mirror](../protocol/disruptions/mirror-mode.md). Yet beneath them lies a deeper truth: **all relations are permeated by undecidability.**\
PoC does not resolve this fragility. Instead, it formalizes it, offering a framework to think and live with the uncertainty at the heart of conscious life.
