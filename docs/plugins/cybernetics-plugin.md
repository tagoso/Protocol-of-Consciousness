# Cybernetics Plugin: PoC as Cybernetics 2.5

The **Protocol of Consciousness (PoC)** can be understood as an **extension of Cybernetics** — the theory proposed by **Norbert Wiener** — and its central concept of **feedback loops**.

Classical cybernetics describes systems composed of **sensors** and **controllers**, in which **reaction** and **feedback** operate. Its key innovation was to reveal that human societies, living organisms, and machines can all be described within a common theory of information and control.

PoC re-situates the locus of consciousness from the inside of the human subject to the _**between**_: to the fragile illusion that arises in the relational space between entities that possess sensors and controllers in the cybernetic sense. Consciousness is thus not housed within a single agent, but is enacted through **a protocol of&#x20;**_**Instantiation**_**,&#x20;**_**Elicitation**_**, and&#x20;**_**Loop**_ between them.

In classical cybernetics, feedback loops are **presupposed as functional and stable**. Models are built on the assumption that closed loops operate reliably, allowing information and control to circulate. PoC diverges precisely here. It defines consciousness not as _guaranteed feedback_, but as _**believed feedback**_: what PoC calls a **Perhaps-Loop.** The loop is sustained not by certainty, but by mutual belief in reciprocity.

In this sense, PoC redefines cybernetic feedback as:

> **Consciousness = a circulation of mutual recognition without guarantee.**

PoC can thus be seen as _Cybernetics 2.5_: a plugin that extends feedback theory into the domain of consciousness, while foregrounding the instability, belief, and illusion that classical cybernetics brackets out.
