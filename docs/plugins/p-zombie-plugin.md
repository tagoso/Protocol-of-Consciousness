# P-Zombie Plugin

### Definition

In philosophy of mind, the “philosophical zombie” (p-zombie) is a being indistinguishable from a human in behavior, yet assumed to lack inner consciousness.

From the standpoint of PoC, the notion of the p-zombie highlights the structural [**unguaranteeability of Instantiation**](../protocol/elicitation-without-instantiation.md):

* Even if Reciprocal Elicitation is returned, there is no way to confirm whether the other has actually instantiated me.
* The distinction between “conscious human” and “zombie” is therefore undecidable in principle.

### PoC Perspective

* [**Ghost Mode**](../protocol/disruptions/ghost-mode.md): Absence of Instantiation, lived “as if” it were present.
* [**Death Mode**](../protocol/disruptions/death-mode.md): Response confirmed impossible.
* [**Zombifying**](../implications/social-practices-phantoming-and-zombifying/zombifying-social-practice-of-making-genuine-fake.md): [Reciprocal Elicitation](../protocol/operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md) observable, yet its authenticity doubtful.

Seen through PoC, the p-zombie problem is not a speculative curiosity but simply another way of stating the **fragility of Loop formation**. To “suspect the other might be a zombie” is a lived stance already captured by PoC’s protocol.

### Key Point

The classical p-zombie thought experiment asks whether a being “without consciousness” is conceivable. PoC reframes the question: _Every encounter already carries this undecidability._

The suspicion that “perhaps the other is a zombie” is not exceptional, but a structural condition of all relations.
