description: Instantiating the Absent

# God Plugin

#### **Definition**

Within PoC, God can be understood as the [**Instantiation**](../protocol/operations/instantiation.md) **of what does not exist**.\
Whether the target exists physically is irrelevant. Just as one can instantiate a curtain, a broom, or even nothingness itself as a conscious presence, one can perform the same operation toward non-existent entities. The most powerful and typical example of this operation is **God**.

#### **Instantiation**

God is generated through the act of raising “a counterpart who is not there” as if it were present. By treating what has no empirical existence as a conscious being, God emerges as a unique target within the protocol of PoC.

#### **Elicitation**

Prayer and faith are forms of [Elicitation](../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md), where one seeks to have one’s own consciousness instantiated within God. Through this act, the believer comes to feel “seen by God” or “speaking to God,” even without any observable confirmation.

#### **Loop**

God does not respond directly. Yet responses are experienced through mediations such as religious communities, scriptures, and rituals. These cultural and social apparatuses function as forms of [**Reciprocal Elicitation**](god-plugin.md#loop), enabling the believer to interpret the situation as if a Loop with God were established.

#### **PoC Interpretation**

The concept of God can be positioned as the **most powerful and typical case study of PoC**, for several reasons:

* [**Radical unguaranteeability**](../implications/undecidability-of-consciousness.md): God’s existence cannot be empirically confirmed, yet Instantiation occurs and Elicitation persists.
* **Connections to Modes**:
  * [_Love Mode_](../protocol/disruptions/love-mode.md): prayer as the persistence of Elicitation without assurance of reply.
  * [_Ghost Mode_](../protocol/disruptions/ghost-mode.md): revelations or “voices of God” experienced as if responses were present.
  * [_Death Mode_](../protocol/disruptions/death-mode.md): God posited on the far side of death’s confirmed absence.
* **Philosophical resonance**: Traditions often interpret God as the culmination of love, the beyond of death, or the [mirror of the self](../protocol/disruptions/mirror-mode.md). PoC does not exclude these readings but reframes them as results of protocolic operations — Instantiation without empirical anchor, sustained through Elicitation and mediated reciprocity.

#### **Key Point**

In PoC, God is not a “special existence” but the **typical example of how the protocol generates targets beyond questions of existence**.

Put differently: **the God of PoC is not the “God who exists,” but the “God who is generated.”**
