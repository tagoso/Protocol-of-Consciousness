# Elicitation without Instantiation

#### 1. Definition and Position

In PoC, **Elicitation without Instantiation** refers to situations where an Elicitation is issued, or interpreted as a response, even though no actual [Instantiation](operations/instantiation.md) occurs on the other’s side.

Crucially, this is not an exceptional “failure” of the protocol but a structural condition inherent to it. Because every Loop is, at its core, a [**Perhaps-Loop**](unguaranteability-all-loops-are-perhaps-loops.md), the possibility that no Instantiation has taken place can never be excluded.

#### 2. Typical Occurrences

* **Animals and machines**\
  When one calls to a cat and interprets its meow as a reply ([Animal Plugin](../plugins/animal-plugin.md)), or when one perceives an [AI](../plugins/ai-plugin.md)’s output as “understanding,” what occurs is precisely Elicitation without Instantiation.
* **Media environments**\
  Influencers speaking as if addressing “only you,” streamers saying “thank you,” or algorithmic notifications arriving at the “perfect” moment — all generate the sense of being recognized without any genuine Instantiation on the sender’s side ([Media Plugin](../plugins/media-plugin.md)).
* **Even among humans**\
  One can never verify whether the other has truly instantiated oneself. A smile, a returned gaze, or a “read” mark may be interpreted as [Reciprocal Elicitation](operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md), but whether it is grounded in genuine Instantiation remains undecidable.

#### 3. Relation to Social Practices

* [**Phantoming**](../implications/social-practices-phantoming-and-zombifying/phantoming-social-practice-of-making-fake-genuine.md)\
  The practice of fabricating a Loop as if genuine institutionalizes Elicitation without Instantiation at the social level.
* [**Zombifying**](../implications/social-practices-phantoming-and-zombifying/zombifying-social-practice-of-making-genuine-fake.md)\
  Conversely, treating the other as absent — nullifying their potential Instantiation — represents the negative mirror of the same condition.

#### 4. Theoretical Implications

* **Against Human Exceptionalism**\
  Whether the counterpart is human, animal, machine, or fictional character, the presence of Instantiation can never be guaranteed. To claim that “because it is human, the Loop must be real” is merely a form of human exceptionalism.
* **Relation to Ghost Mode**\
  In this sense, the entire protocol operates on the condition of [Ghost Mode](disruptions/ghost-mode.md): interactions in which responses are unverifiable yet lived as real.
* **Relation to** [**Self-Consciousness**](../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md)\
  In [Mirror Mode](disruptions/mirror-mode.md), the “position of the other” is internalized, and circulation occurs without any external Instantiation. This, too, exemplifies Elicitation without Instantiation — an inwardly staged version of the same dynamic.

***

#### 5. Summary

**Elicitation without Instantiation** is not a marginal aberration but the very ground on which PoC rests. Since all Loops are Perhaps-Loops, the possibility of absent Instantiation is unavoidable. Far from weakening the framework, this condition is what generates the diversity of Modes and social practices. It is the structural fissure through which the illusion of consciousness takes form, sustained in belief and lived as reality.
