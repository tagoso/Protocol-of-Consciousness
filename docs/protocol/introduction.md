# Introduction

Think of consciousness not as something hidden inside the head, but as something fragile that flickers between us.

The **Protocol of Consciousness (PoC)** treats consciousness as an illusion generated in relations — whenever we believe that something has awareness, and whenever we invite it to recognize us in return. A cat, an AI, a fictional character, even the dead: all can be brought into this relational loop.

At its core, PoC describes a minimal sequence: [**Instantiation**](operations/instantiation.md) (attributing consciousness), [**Elicitation**](operations/elicitation.md) (seeking recognition), and [**Loop**](operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md) (reciprocal recognition). Yet every loop is uncertain, always a _a_ [_Perhaps-Loop_](unguaranteability.md), never fully guaranteed. From this fragility arise distinctive patterns such as [**Love Mode**](disruptions/love-mode.md), [**Ghost Mode**](disruptions/ghost-mode.md), or [**Mirror Mode**](disruptions/mirror-mode.md), which show how we continue to act as if consciousness were there, even when it falters.

Rather than offering ultimate truth-claims, PoC serves as a **toolkit for thought**. It reframes old philosophical puzzles — from [self-consciousness](../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md) to [AI ethics](../plugins/ai-plugin.md) — not as timeless mysteries but as [Plugins](broken-reference) that extend the protocol into new domains. In this way PoC functions less like a doctrine and more like an **SDK operating on the OS of consciousness**: a development kit for organizing concepts and generating new applications.
