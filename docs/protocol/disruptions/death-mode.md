# Death Mode

### **Definition**

Death Mode is the mode in which the dead are experienced as pure absence. In this state, [**Elicitation**](../operations/elicitation.md) no longer reaches the other, and neither Instantiation nor [**Reciprocal Elicitation**](../operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md) is possible. The very possibility of the Loop collapses.

### **Features**

* **Certainty of absence**: Unlike [Ghost Mode](ghost-mode.md), where response is uncertain yet experienced _as if_ present, Death Mode involves the conviction that _“no response will ever come again.”_ What is at stake here is not ambiguity but a confirmed rupture.
* **Ritual confirmation**: Funerary practices such as burial or cremation function as communal affirmations of this definitive rupture.
* **Memory and persistence**: The dead may reappear in Ghost Mode through memory or narrative, but each appearance is ultimately recollected into the recognition that _“they are no longer here.”_
* **Radical impossibility of the Loop:** Elicitation may still be directed toward the other, but the possibility of its return as a Loop is, in principle, reduced to zero. This includes not only the dead but also entities that were never regarded in terms of Instantiation at all — such as landscapes, stones, or objects that one does not ordinarily imagine as conscious. In Death Mode, they are apprehended precisely as pure absence, beyond the horizon of possible reciprocity.

### **Examples**

* _Funeral_: The overwhelming conviction that no reply will ever return.
* _Irreversibility of cremation_: The physical disappearance of the body confirms the impossibility of response.
* _An adult losing a balloon_: Unlike a child, an adult does not cry over a lost balloon, since they already know that no Reciprocal Elicitation will ever come from it.

### **Key Point**

Death Mode marks the point at which the framework of **Elicitation and Loop** within PoC collapses at its root.

* In **Ghost Mode**, response is absent yet experienced _as if_ it were present.
* In [**Zombie thought experiments**](../../plugins/p-zombie-plugin.md), response appears, but whether Instantiation has truly occurred remains undecidable.
* In **Death Mode**, however, response is confirmed impossible.

Elicitation becomes isolated, and the possibility of the Loop vanishes. This **confirmation of rupture** is the essence of the experience of death.
