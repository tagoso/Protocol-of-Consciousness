# Love Mode

### **Definition**

Love Mode is a mode in which an [**Elicitation**](../operations/elicitation.md) **(e\_{A→B})** toward the other continues even when the completion of the Loop is not guaranteed. [**Reciprocal Elicitation**](../operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md) **(e\_{B→A})** is uncertain: it may be absent, or it may be delayed. Yet in Love, this uncertainty is not resisted but embraced, and within it the Elicitation persists as a form of endurance.

### **Features**

* **Acceptance of uncertainty**: Whether the Loop will close is never assured. Nevertheless, Elicitation continues, sustained by a willingness to remain exposed to this indeterminacy.
* **Temporal openness**: Reciprocity does not need to be immediate. Elicitation can be held across time, animated by the faith that a response may one day arrive.
* **Expectation of Instantiation on the other side**: Love continues even when Instantiation by the other is not obvious, supported by the conviction — sometimes fragile, sometimes unshakable — that it may yet emerge.

### **Examples**

* _Parental love_: Love persists even when the child cannot yet respond; sometimes Reciprocal Elicitation arrives only belatedly, through the child’s later growth.
* _Unrequited love_: The establishment of the Loop remains uncertain, yet Elicitation endures, nourished by faith rather than reciprocity.

### **Key Point**

What defines Love Mode is the persistence of **Elicitation** as endurance in the face of uncertainty or delay in the other’s Instantiation and Reciprocity. The completion of the Loop is desirable, but its absence does not invalidate Elicitation. On the contrary, it is precisely the continuation of Elicitation — carried by faith, despite the absence of assurance — that constitutes the essence of Love Mode.
