# Operations

To see how this works in practice, let me outline the basic sequence of the Protocol of Consciousness.

First, consciousness appears as the consciousness of the other. When an agent assumes, _“you are conscious”_ — an act we call [**Instantiation**](instantiation.md) — an illusion of the other’s mind is generated within the agent. The other need not be human: it may be an anime character, a cow, a curtain, or even emptiness itself. At this stage, however, the illusion of the other’s consciousness is typically subjective and unstable.

What follows is [**Elicitation**](elicitation.md): a bid arising from the desire that _“my own consciousness be instantiated within the other.”_ Concretely, this may take the form of waving, speaking, calling someone’s name, or making eye contact — simple gestures that reach outward as if to demand recognition.

When the other responds with a [**Reciprocal Elicitation**](loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md), this response carries a double movement. The other both regards me as conscious and at the same time demands, _“regard me as conscious as well.”_ When this mutual call and response circulates, a [**Loop**](loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md) is formed between them. The Loop stabilizes the illusion and provides a mechanism by which each side’s “consciousness” is mutually secured.

In this way, consciousness is treated not as an essence residing in the self, but as a process that is relationally generated, maintained, and dissolved in PoC. And it is this loop of mutual elicitation that underpins trust, cooperation, institutions — in short, the very foundations of society.

### Operation Process

[**Instantiation**](instantiation.md)

An illusion of the other’s consciousness arises internally.

_(Example: when observing someone through a camera, they appear as if they are conscious.)_

↓

[**Elicitation**](elicitation.md)

An agent bids for the other to instantiate them as conscious.

_(Concrete forms: waving, calling someone’s name, greeting aloud, or sending a message — gestures that carry the intent “see me as conscious.”)_

↓

**Reciprocal Elicitation**

The other responds with a double movement: regarding me as conscious while at the same time demanding, _“regard me as conscious too.”_

_(An agent believes their instantiation occurs within the other, and an illusion of their own consciousness arises there.)_

↓

[**Loop**](loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md)

Reciprocal Elicitations stabilize through circulation.

* The boundary between subject and object becomes blurred.
* Through assimilation, [the illusion of self-consciousness](../../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md) reinforces itself.

### Quick Notation (for reference)

* _i\_A(B)_ = Instantiation of B’s consciousness within A
* _e\_{A→B}_ = Elicitation: A’s bid for B to instantiate A
* _e\_{B→A}_ = Reciprocal Elicitation (when returned by B)
* **Loop** = Mutual Elicitations (_e\_{A→B}_ & _e\_{B→A}_) establishing responsiveness
