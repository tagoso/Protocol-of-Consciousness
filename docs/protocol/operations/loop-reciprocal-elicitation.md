# Loop (Reciprocal Elicitation)

In PoC, a **Loop** refers to the state in which two subjects engage in [**Elicitation**](elicitation.md) toward one another, such that each appears to see their own illusion of consciousness instantiated within the other.

In other words, a one-sided Elicitation becomes stabilized when it is met with a **Reciprocal Elicitation** from the other, giving rise to a **Loop** **of mutual Elicitation**.

Everyday conversation is a typical example. When someone calls out to another, the act already contains the implicit assumption: _“You recognize me.”_ When the other responds — by replying, returning a gaze, or some other gesture — that initial illusion gains reinforcement through the response. At that moment, the two exchange **Elicitations** (each expecting Instantiation in the other), and the Loop is set into motion.

This reciprocity is always fragile. We can never objectively know whether an Elicitation is truly met with Instantiation on the other side. Even to an external observer, [every loop remains a _perhaps-loop_](../unguaranteability.md): there is no principled way to separate an elicitation with instantiation from [one without](../elicitation-without-instantiation.md). Yet for the participants themselves, the very belief that _“it is mutual”_ sustains the Loop’s continuation. And once that belief collapses, the Loop unravels. Consciousness, in this view, is nothing other than [the tension of maintaining this fragile reciprocity](../consciousness-as-tension.md).

Thus, a Loop is not secured by objective evidence, but exists through the subjective co-presence of simultaneous Elicitations; its power lies precisely in this unstable equilibrium — where the boundary between subject and object wavers, and from that wavering, [the fundamental illusion of self-consciousness arises](../../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md).
