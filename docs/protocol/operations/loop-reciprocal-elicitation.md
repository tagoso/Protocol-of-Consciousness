# Loop (Reciprocal Elicitation)

In PoC, a **Loop** refers to the state in which two subjects engage in [**Elicitation**](elicitation.md) toward one another, such that each appears to see their own illusion of consciousness instantiated within the other.

In other words, a one-sided Elicitation becomes stabilized when it is met with a **Reciprocal Elicitation** from the other, giving rise to a Loop of mutual Elicitation.

Everyday conversation is a typical example. When someone calls out to another, the act already contains the implicit assumption: _“You recognize me.”_ When the other responds — by replying, returning a gaze, or some other gesture — that initial illusion gains reinforcement through the response. At that moment, the two exchange **Elicitations** (each expecting Instantiation in the other), and the Loop is set into motion.

What matters here is that, within mutual Elicitation, the boundary between subject and object begins to blur. When each feels that _“I appear within the other,”_ consciousness no longer seems to rest upon the distinction between self and other, but is instead experienced — however illusorily — as if shared within a single field. It may be precisely here that [the illusion of self-consciousness arises](../../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md). In this way, self-consciousness is always an illusion.

Of course, this reciprocity is always unstable. One can never objectively verify whether true Instantiation occurs on the other’s side when Elicitation is observed. Even from a third-person perspective, [it is impossible in principle to distinguish a _Genuine Loop_ from a _Fake Loop_](../unguaranteability-all-loops-are-perhaps-loops.md), or [Elicitation without Instantiation](../elicitation-without-instantiation.md). Yet for the participants themselves, the very belief that _“it is mutual”_ sustains the Loop’s continuation. And once that belief collapses, so too does the Loop.

Thus, a Loop is not secured by objective evidence, but exists through the subjective co-presence of simultaneous Elicitations; its power lies precisely in this unstable equilibrium — where the boundary between subject and object wavers, and from that wavering, [the fundamental illusion of self-consciousness arises](../../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md). In this sense, every Loop is, by definition, a Perhaps-Loop: it persists not because Instantiation can ever be confirmed, but because the participants sustain the belief that reciprocity holds.
