# Consciousness as Tension

### Position within the Core Structure of PoC

The basic operations of PoC are composed of **Instantiation → Elicitation → Reciprocal Elicitation → Loop**. Yet all of these are governed by [**Unguaranteeability**](unguaranteability.md): one can never confirm whether the other has truly instantiated me, or whether my Elicitation has been received.

Nevertheless, people continue to believe that a Loop has been established, and it is this belief that sustains the interaction. The condition of “persisting despite the uncertainty of establishment” is what PoC calls **Tension**.

**Definition**: _Consciousness as Tension = the experiential state in which the Loop is sustained by belief, even while the success of Instantiation or Elicitation remains uncertain._

### Relation to Modes

[Modes](disruptions/#disruptive-modes) can be organized as distinct responses to this Tension:

* [**Love Mode**](disruptions/love-mode.md): calling out even without response (endurance of tension).
* [**Ghost Mode**](disruptions/ghost-mode.md): believing in response even when it cannot be verified (affirmation of tension).
* [**Death Mode**](disruptions/death-mode.md): confirming that no response will ever come (termination of tension).
* [**Mirror Mode**](disruptions/mirror-mode.md): internalizing the other and circulating tension within the self.

Thus, all Modes are nothing but modalities of responding to **Consciousness as Tension**.

### Relation to Other Theoretical Concepts

* [**Undecidability**](../implications/undecidability-of-consciousness.md): the logical constraint that whether Instantiation or Reciprocal Elicitation has truly occurred can never be decided in principle.
* [**Structural Paradox**](../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md): the structure by which the “me-in-the-other,” which exists only inside myself, is nonetheless believed to exist outside.
* **Tension**: the experiential modality in which such constraints and paradoxes are lived — the felt condition of sustaining relations amid uncertainty.

### Summary

From the standpoint of PoC, [**every Loop is a Perhaps-Loop**](unguaranteability.md).

**Consciousness as Tension** is precisely the state in which belief sustains the Loop within uncertainty — the lived experience of keeping reciprocity alive despite its fundamental fragility.
