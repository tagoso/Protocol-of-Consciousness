# Mirror Mode

#### **Definition**

Mirror Mode is a mode in which Elicitation is not directed outward toward another, but is turned inward toward oneself. The self constructs “the position of the other” within itself, generating an internal [Instantiation](../operations/instantiation.md) _i\_A(A)_. In this way, the framework of Instantiation–[Elicitation](../operations/elicitation.md)–[Loop](../operations/loop-reciprocal-elicitation.md) is not abolished but imported into the inner domain. Mirror Mode is not itself self-consciousness, but the structural condition through which [the paradox of self-consciousness becomes possible](../../implications/self-consciousness-as-structual-paradox.md).

#### **Features**

* **Construction of the inner other**: The self generates an internal figure — “the self who looks,” “the self who speaks” — and directs virtual Elicitation toward it.
* **Formation of an internal Loop**: Within this framework, Elicitation and Reciprocal Elicitation circulate internally. This is experienced as inner dialogue, self-observation, or the sense of being watched by oneself.
* **Self-objectification**: By occupying the position of the other, the self gains the ability to regard and address itself as if from an external standpoint.

#### **Examples**

* **Mirror stage**: An infant identifies with its own reflection, both recognizing it as self and misrecognizing it as an external figure.
* **Inner dialogue**: Silent conversation with an imagined other self.
* **Diaries and monologues**: Writing addressed to “someone” becomes a staging of the inner other who will one day read.

#### **Key Point**

Mirror Mode is not a disruption of PoC, but its inversion: the very mechanics that ordinarily operate between self and other are turned inward. What is imported is the _form of the Loop_, not its external reciprocity.

This inward staging of the other lays the groundwork for self-consciousness. Yet self-consciousness itself does not simply arise from mirroring. It emerges when the illusion “me-in-the-other” — generated under the assumption of reciprocity — is carried back and sustained within the self. Thus, Mirror Mode provides the structural precondition, while the structural paradox of “the external being internal all along” constitutes the true emergence of self-consciousness.
